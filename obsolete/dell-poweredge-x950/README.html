These patches modify the latest Ubuntu 2.6.12 kernel (for Breezy) to support
Dell's 9th generation hardware (1950, 2950, etc.).

Obtain the latest Ubuntu 2.6.12 kernel source:

apt-get source linux-source-2.6.12

All pathnames mentioned are relative to the kernel package's top-level
directory (e.g., linux-source-2.6.12-2.6.12).

Copy these four patch files to debian/patches/. Edit
debian/patches/00list-KERNELVERSION, where KERNELVERSION is the Debian
version component from the topmost changelog entry in debian/changelog.
For example, if the first entry in debian/changelog is:

linux-source-2.6.12 (2.6.12-10.35) breezy-security; urgency=low

KERNELVERSION should be replaced with 10.35, so you would edit
debian/patches/00list-10.35. Add:

megaraid-sas
megaraid-sas2
megaraid-sas3
bnx2-updates

to the bottom of this file.

You may want to add a new changelog entry to debian/changes indicating that
these patches have been added.

Run:

dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot

from the package's top-level directory (linux-source-2.6.12-2.6.12). It will
emit .debs in the parent directory.
